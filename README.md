# **Extended version**

This version will gradually get the extras when I have the time for it, since I added them without a repo and just in studio (sorry). That means it's currently incomplete.

Beware when trying to use this, it might not work because I probably forgot to add an action or something, or the IDE isn't clear enough... (how do you use this thing)

**This fork includes:**
 - Damage knockback actions
 - Quicksand actions
 - Hangable ceiling climbing
 - Other cutscene actions
 - Missing codeblocks (the oopsies)

Will not be fixing the glitches in them!! (will keep the comments that point them out however)

## Will not be including

From some of my video footage, I will not include:
 - HUD graphics
 - Skybox
 - Shadow rendering (plain simple to do it)
 - That weird SM64 lighting rendering (recreation isn't the best, for how it should look see [vinesauce video clip](https://youtu.be/tM2UKKAJLiY?t=2038))
