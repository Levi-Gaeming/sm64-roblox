# **Extended version**

This version will gradually get the extras when I have the time for it, since I added them without a repo and just in studio (sorry).

**This includes:**
 - Damage knockback actions
 - Quicksand actions
 - Hangable ceiling climbing
 - Other cutscene actions
 - Missing codeblocks (the oopsies)

Will not be fixing the glitches in them!! (will keep the comments that point them out however)

## Will not be including

From some of my video footage, I will not include:
 - HUD graphics
 - Skybox
 - Shadow rendering (plain simple to do it)
